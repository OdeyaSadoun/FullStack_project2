Welcome to the world of games
A site that contains games :)


******index.html******
The login page, there is an option to connect or register.

******index.js******
Contains the logic of the page, mostly beyond the proper HTML pages.

******index.css******
Contains the appropriate style for the registration page.



In order to connect to the site, you must first register.


******registration.html******
The form contains the form file.
Contains 3 types of buttons: register, reset the data and go back to the main page - index.html.
In addition, there are simple input verifications such as a template for the phone number, or a template for the email.

******registration.js******
This file has a variety of input validations, both for the name field and the password field.
Beyond that, there is a check that the user is indeed not registered in the system, and that he has filled in the fields as required.
And in addition, of course, a check that the entered password is the same as the password verification

******registration.css******
Contains the appropriate style for the registration page.



Logging in to the system is done by entering a correct username and password.


******login.html******
Contains the appropriate style for the registration page.
Contains a form for entering username and password details, and contains 3 buttons like the registration page.
In addition, if a user is not registered - you can easily go to the registration page.

******login.js******
If there is an error in entering the details, due to the tests that are carried out it will not be possible to connect to the system.

******login.css******
Contains the appropriate style for the login page.



When a correct login is made to the system, you enter the main page of the site, which is the games page.


******games.html******
Contains a flex of 8 games, 2 of which are realized and the rest are in development.

******games.js******
By clicking on the various images of the games, you can see that we will receive a message that the game will be enabled soon.
By clicking on the 2 relevant games: a hanging man and a learning game, the user will go to the corresponding game page.

******games.css******
Contains the appropriate style for the games page.


!!!!!!!!Learning game:!!!!!!!!

It is carried out by 3 stages, each stage contains:

******game1.html/ game1_2.html/ game1_3.html******
A grid that contains pictures of numbers/letters/letters in English depending on the level.
On the side there is a navigation option between the different stages.

******game1.js/ game1_2.js/ game1_3.js******
Each click on an image will bring another image that helps learn about the number/letter.
In the first stage you get a point for each click, in the second stage 2 points and in the third stage 3 points.

******game1.css/ game1_2.css/ game1_3.css******
Contains the appropriate style for the Learning game pages.


H!!!!!!!!Hanging man game!!!!!!!!

******game2.html******
The game appears in the form of buttons according to the number of letters of the alphabet and a large square in which the "hanging" man will be drawn according to the user's disqualifications.

******game2.js******
In this game, the computer grills a word and a category.
The user must guess the word using the letters of the alphabet.
The apricot has 10 lives - that is, 10 possibilities to fail.

If the user guesses the word - his profit is 10 points.
If he uses a hint, he loses 5 points.
And all this, of course, if he managed to decipher the word.

If not, no points will be added to his account.

There is an option to click on a new game - then the game resets and you start from the beginning.

******game2.css******
Contains the appropriate style for the Hanging man game page.


******The personal area:******

******PrivateArea.html/ PrivateArea.css/ PrivateArea.js******
Like every site we have the personal area
In the personal area you can see the status of the user's points,
the table of users with the score and the latest activity on the site,
so that the user can know what his position is in terms of points with the other users of the site.


In general, you can see that we have more css files which are:

******general.css******
which contains the overall design throughout the site, keeping it uniform.

******header.css******
which contains the design for the header which is also repeated on most of the website.


In addition, a cute feature we have:)
When you enter any page, at the top of the page near the exit and return
(which are links that obviously work) you can see for each user a greeting and their score status.



GOOD LUCK!!!
